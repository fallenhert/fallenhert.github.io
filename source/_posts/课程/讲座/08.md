**Lecturer: Evangeline Young**

# Part 1: Introduction

IC Design Flow

- System Specification
- Architectural Design
- Functional & Logic Design
- Logic Synthesis
- **Physical Design**
- Mask Synthesis & Verification
- Fabrication
- Packaging and Testing



EDA(Electronic Design Automation) 协助排列硬件设计中的电路元件

NVIDIA, HUAWEI



**What is EDA about?**

EDA for semi-custom VLSI

- VLSI = Very Large Scale Integrated circuits
- Semi-custom = Not fully customized, some parts of the design are re-used



VLSI Design Cycle

- Architectural Design  
- Functional Design
- Logic Design
- Circuit Design 
- Physical Design
- Fabrication
- Packaging



**Chip Planning Examples**

FloorPlanning and  Placement



Full Custom Design

Field Programmable Gate Array(FPGA)



Manufacturing: Transport of an EUV System

Future Development



# Part 2: Floorplanning - An EDA Example

**Floorplanning Problem Formulation**

>Given: Three blocks with the following potential widths and heights
>
>Task: Floorplan with minimum total area enclosed

General Floorplan Problem Formulation



**Analytical Approach**



**Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP)**



**Non-overlap Constraints**



**Solving Linear Program**

LP

MILP is NP-Complete

Solvers: gurobi, cplex, lpsolve
