**Calculation of returns**

收益计算

- simple interest convention 简单利益惯例
  - e.g. 6-month rate is 4.8%: \$1000 x (1 + 0.048 x 0.5) = \$1024
- annual compounding convention 年复利惯例
  - e.g. 2-year interest rate is 5%: \$1000 x (1+0.05)^2 = \$1102.5
- semi-annual compounding convention 半年复利惯例
  - e.g. 2-year interest rate is 5.1%: \$1000 x (1+0.051/2)^(2x2) = \$1105.96
- continuous compounding convention 持续复利惯例
  - e.g. 3-year interest rate is 5.3%: \$1000 x e^(0/053x3) = \$1172.34

# Topic 1-1: DERIVATIVE MARKET AND INSTRUMENTS

## Financial derivatives

A contract "derived" from some underlying asset prices

Payoff could be linear or non-linear

Could involve multiple assests/currencies

Provide instruments for risk transfer

Market completeness

Could be highly leveraged

Listed instruments could be very liquid; very efficient as a speculative tool

**arbitrage**: the possibility of setting up a trading strategy such that a riskless profit could be earned

**Fair value**: Models are used to find the "fair value" of an instrument

## Interest rate parity

Interest rate of currency 1 = r1
Interest rate of currency 2 = r2
Spot FX rate is expressed as: 1 unit of currency 1 = Sunits of currency 2
At time t, 1 unit of Currency 1 becomes (1+r1t); S units of Currency 2 becomes S(1+r2t)

theoretical foward FX rate $F = S\frac{1+ r_{2}t}{1+r_{1}t}$

## Futures contracts 期货合约

contracts includes: equity, interest rates, fx, commodity

Index futures: 指数期货 Standardized contract, Daily market-to-market, Margining, Fixed maturities, Electronic, Liquidity

**Fair value of (equity) index futures**

$F = (S-D)(1+r_{t}t)$

$F$: fair value of the futures

$S$: today's index level

$r_{t}$: interest rate from today to futures expiry

$t$: time from today to futures expiry

$D$: present value of all dividends paid before futures expiry(equivalent index points)

## Option 期权

terminology:

- call option
- put option
- option premium
- option maturity date

European and American options

- European option: option holder could only exercise the right at maturity
- American option: option holder could exercise the right at any time up to maturity

The holder of an American option has more choices, therefore this option **could NEVER be cheaper than the corresponding European option; usually it is more expensive**

Option examples:

- stock option
- FX option
- Interest rate cap

call and put option examples

**Moneyness**: at-the-money(asset price = strike), in-the-money(payout of option is positive), out-of-the-money(payout of option is 0)
