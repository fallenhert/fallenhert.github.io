## Efficient Production(speed up the prodcution)

黑白漫画采用报纸印刷技术
Structure-aware Halftoning

Manga screening

Closure-aware Simplification

## Digital Migration

> reproduce in color

Manga colorization

Manga/Cartoon Deringing

> pattern Continuity
> Shading & texture (Screening / Hatching)

> Gabor Wavelet Feature
> 将图片解析成不同部分，不同部分用不同的向量来表示（横向/纵向）
> 可以多层解析
> 叠加旋转
> multi-scale/ multi-orientation
> Distance Map 相似度评价
> Level Set Propagation
> Representative Feature
> pattern continuity (Feature samples - Representative feature)
> Pattern - Continuous Propagation

## Deep Learning: Effective Optimization

- early handcrafted approaches

  - Formulate the problem and then tailormade a solution
  - sometimes hard to formulate
  - fail easily whne input is noisy or ambiguous
  - does not need training data

- Deep Learning
  - A black box: not always scientifically explainable
  - Data is crucial

**When Data is Scare**

- What if is hard/costly to collect
- What if no groundtruth exists

Case Study: Localization

Localization of manga/comic is sometimes desired to suit the market preference

Manga Filling Style: Screentone vs Color

Structure Extraction. Current industry: hand by hand. Existing Methods: Traditional edge detectores; Crisp Boundary

Tailor-made Methods: Manga Colorization

**Method Overview**

Difficulties in Tracing

- Inverse technique -> simulates screening
- Time consuming
- Misdrawing while tracing

screentone preparation

Synthesis Rules
Rule1:
Rule2: Prevent filling solid black to adjacent regions

## Sketch Colorization

Difficulties in Colorization

- No unique solution
- Abstract nature of sketches
- User control is desired

Existing Works

- Color Propagation methods:
  - TV lazybrush
  - Manga Colorization
- Learning-based methods:
  - Style transfer
  - Image-to-image Translation

Methodology Overview

- Traditinal image translation Method
- Propoesd Method
  - Colorization is a complex process
    - Creation: Chossing color composition
    - Refinement: Fixing color excedding boundary, maintaining consistent color over a region
  - Two-stage colorization model
    - Drafting Stage
    - Refinement Stage

The Drafting Stage

- Enrich color combination
- Learn to determine the global color composition
- Aggressively colorize sketch by the positive regulation loss
- Increase the color variance in RGB space

The Refinement Stage

- Random region paste
  - To simulate mistakenly assigned colors
- Region proposal: crop random image regions
- Random paste
- Random color spay

**Overall Network Structure**
Refinement network is also a GAN

Manga Filling Style Conversion with Screentone Method

Region-wise v.s. Point-wise Reperesentation

Overview

Screened manga --screenEncoder--> ScreenVAE map --Screen2Color--> Color comic
Screened mange <--screenDecoder-- ScreenVAE map <--Color2Screen-- Color comic

Goal of ScreenVAE

- Summarization
- Interpolation

Lose function of Screen VAE

- KL
- TO further introduce region awareness

Results: Color-filling to Screening
