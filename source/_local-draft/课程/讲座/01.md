# Introduction to Computation Models

**Lecturer: Yufei Tao**

Computer Science is a subject of mathematics.

Different **computation models** produce different branches of the subject.

Several mainstream models

## 1. Random Access Machine(RAM)

**Atomic operations**( `a` and `b` are registers ):

- $a \leftarrow 100, a \leftarrow b$
- $a + b, a- b, a * b , a/b$
- $a < b, a=b,a > b$
- read a memory cell into `a`, or write `a` into a memory cell

**Time** of an algorithm = # atomic operations performed

**The Sorting Problem**:

Given an array A of n distinct integers, produce another array where the same integers have been arranged in ascending order.

**Merge Sort**

## 2. Parallel Random Access Machine(PRAM)

parallel execution

A **step**: each CPU **independently** performs _an atomic operation_(`a` and `b` are registers inside the CPU)

- $a \leftarrow 100, a \leftarrow b$
- $a + b, a- b, a * b , a/b$
- $a < b, a=b,a > b$
- read a memory cell into `a`, or write `a` into a memory cell

> **Constraint**: In a step, no two CPUs can write to the same cell.

**CREW** model (common read exclusive write)

**The Sorting Problem**

Given an array A of n $\geq$ p distinct integers, produce another array where the same integers have been arranged in ascending order.

Naive: $O(nlogn)$ steps

Optimal: $O(\frac{n}{p}logn)$ steps

how to do $O(\frac{n}{p}log^{2}n)$ steps? (assume p = n.s p < n is left)

**The Merging Problem**

Let $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$ be two sorted arrays, each with $\frac{p}{2}$ integers. Merge $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$ into one sorted array(with p integers).

Naive: $O(p)$ steps

We will do $O(logp)$ steps.

Eg.

## 3.External Memory Model

a dataset is stored in the disk

A **I/O**

- reads a disk block into memory, or
- writes B memory words into a disk block

> CPU calculation is for free

**The Sorting Problem**

Given a file A of n $\geq$ B distinct integers stored in $O(n/B)$ blocks, produce another file of $O(n/B)$ blocks where the same integers have been arranged in ascending order.

Naive: $O(nlogn)$ I/Os

We will do: $O(\frac{n}{B}log_{\frac{M}{B}} \frac{n}{B})$ I/Os

**The Mergin Problem**

how to solve the problem in $O{\frac{t}{B}}$ I/Os

Think: equipped with the above merging algorithm, how can we solve the sorting problem in $O(\frac{n}{B}log_{\frac{M}{B}}{\frac{n}{B}})$ I/Os ?
